We created a virtual reality game. Our story line starts with a telescope being stolen by aliens, we embark on a journey in space to retrieve the telescope. The player enters into a maze looking for the scattered parts of the telescope which when collected, the information will be provided to player as a voiceover. The player has to fight against aliens to sustain their health bar and collect all the components. The player has to collect all the required components of the telescope in the given time limit. When the player successfully collects all of the telescope parts then the user will be able to view the 3D model of the James Webb Space Telescope. The player will then have the access to explore various images captured by the telescope which will be heard in a voiceover.
